    <string name="on_boarding_desc_1">Let’s face it — dating online is lonely and boring.  You\'re \"introduced\" to people you\'d  never date and have no idea how they are connected to your life.  With FWD, you can change that by inviting your trusted humans (Tribe) to help you out.</string>
    <string name="on_boarding_title_2">Connection Through People You Trust, Not Just An Algorithm</string>
    <string name="on_boarding_desc_2">Your Tribe members introduce you to people they know in real life.  They also send you profile recommendations of people already on FWD.</string>
    <string name="on_boarding_title_3">More Personalized, Meaningful Information "</string>
    <string name="on_boarding_desc_3">You learn how your prospective match is connected you and your Tribe — and what your Tribe thinks of them.  And if you don’t want to build a Tribe, you don’t have to. You can go solo and swipe alone.</string>

    <string name="on_boarding_desc_4">You\'re no longer dating alone online and talking to random people you don\'t know.  Chat with your Tribe about their real-life connections, your matches, about life.    And, hey, send them a coin for all their help. </string>
